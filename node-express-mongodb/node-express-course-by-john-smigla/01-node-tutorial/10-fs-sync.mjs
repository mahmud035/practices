 * NOTE:
 * Synchronous file operations are `blocking`, meaning that the code execution will stop until the operation is complete.

 * For most cases, it's recommended to use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread.

 * The `readFileSync` function is used to read data from a file synchronously.
 * The `writeFileSync` function is used to write data to a file synchronously.
