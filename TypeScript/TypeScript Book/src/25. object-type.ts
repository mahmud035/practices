  // Object Types

  // In TypeScript, object types describe the shape of an object. They specify the names and types of the object’s properties, as well as whether those properties are required or optional.

  // In TypeScript, you can define object types in two primary ways:

  // Interface which defines the shape of an object by specifying the names, types, and optionality of its properties.

  interface User {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    email?: string;
  }

  // Type alias, similar to an interface, defines the shape of an object. However, it can also create a new custom type that is based on an existing type or a combination of existing types. This includes defining union types, intersection types, and other complex types.

  type Point = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };

  // It also possible to define a type anonymously:

  const sum = (x: { a: number; b: number }) => x.a + x.b;

  console.log(sum({ a: 5, b: 1 }));
}
