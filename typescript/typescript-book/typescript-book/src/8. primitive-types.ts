  // Primitive Types

  // NOTE: TypeScript supports 7 primitive types. "A primitive data type refers to a type that is not an object and does not have any methods associated with it." In TypeScript, all primitive types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are assigned.

  // 1. string

  // The `string` primitive type stores textual data, and the value is always double or single-quoted.

  const x: string = 'x';
  const y: string = 'y';

  // Strings can span multiple lines if surrounded by the backtick (``) character:

  let sentence: string = `
    multi
    line
    string`;

  // 2. number

  // A `number` data type in TypeScript is represented with a 64-bit floating point value. A `number` type can represent integers and fractions. TypeScript also supports hexadecimal, binary, and octal, for instance:

  const decimal: number = 10;
  const hexadecimal: number = 0xa0dd; // Hexadecimal starts with 0x
  const binary: number = 0b1010; // Binary starts with 0b
  const octal: number = 0o633; // Octal starts with 0o

  // 3. boolean

  // The `boolean` data type in TypeScript stores a binary value, either `true` or `false`.

  const isReady: boolean = true;

  // 4. bigInt

  // A `bigInt` represents numeric values that are very large (2^53 ‚Äì 1) and cannot be represented with a number.

  // A `bigInt` can be created by calling the built-in function `BigInt()` or by adding `n` to the end of any integer numeric literal:

  {
    const x: bigint = BigInt(9007199254740991);
    const y: bigint = 9007199254740991n;
  }

  // NOTE:
  // üëâ `bigInt` values cannot be mixed with `number` and cannot be used with built-in `Math`, they must be coerced to the same type.

  // üëâ `bigInt` values are available only if target configuration is ES2020 or higher.

  // 5. Symbol

  // 6 & 7. null and undefined

  // IMPORTANT: `null` Vs. `undefined`:
  /*
  * `null` and `undefined` types both represent "no value" or the "absence of any value".

  * The `undefined` type means the value is not assigned or initialized or indicates an "unintentional absence of value".

  * The `null` type means that we know that the field does not have a value, so value is unavailable, it "indicates an intentional absence of value".
 */

  // Array

  // An `array` is a data type that can store multiple values of the same type or not. It can be defined using the following syntax:

  {
    const x: string[] = ['a', 'b'];
    const y: Array<string> = ['a', 'b'];
    const z: (string | number)[] = ['a', 1, 'b', 2]; // Union
  }

  // TypeScript supports readonly arrays using the following syntax:

  {
    const x: readonly string[] = ['a', 'b']; // Readonly modifier
    const y: ReadonlyArray<string> = ['a', 'b'];
    const z: readonly (string | number)[] = ['a', 1, 'b', 2];

    // z.push('x'); // üî¥ Invalid
  }

  // TypeScript supports tuple and readonly tuple:

  {
    const x: [string, number] = ['a', 1];
    const y: readonly [string, number] = ['a', 1];
  }

  // any

  // The `any` data type represents literally ‚Äúany‚Äù value, it is the default value when TypeScript cannot infer the type or is not specified.

  // When using `any` TypeScript compiler skips the type checking so there is no type safety when `any` is being used. Generally do not use `any` to silence the compiler when an error occurs, instead focus on fixing the error as with using `any` it is possible to break contracts and we lose the benefits of TypeScript autocomplete.

  // The `any` type could be useful during a gradual migration from JavaScript to TypeScript, as it can silence the compiler.

  // For new projects use TypeScript configuration `noImplicitAny` which enables TypeScript to issue errors where `any` is used or inferred.

  // The `any` type is usually a source of errors which can mask real problems with your types. "Avoid using it as much as possible".
