  // Exploring the Type System

  {
    //* Assign a type: Type Declarations and Type Assertions

    type X = {
      a: string;
    };

    // Type Declaration
    const obj1: X = {
      a: 'a',
      // b: 'b', // 🔴 Error: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'b' does not exist in type 'X'.
    };

    // Type Assertion
    const obj2: X = {
      a: 'a',
      b: 'b', // ✅ Can be added additional property
    } as X;

    // NOTE: In the above example, the object `obj2` is asserted to have the type `X` using the `as` keyword. This informs the TypeScript compiler that the object conforms to the specified type, even though it has an additional property `b` not present in the type definition.

    // Type assertions are useful in situations where a more specific type needs to be specified, especially when working with the DOM. For instance:

    const myInput = document.getElementById('my-input') as HTMLInputElement;

    // Here, the type assertion as HTMLInputElement is used to tell TypeScript that the result of getElementById should be treated as an HTMLInputElement.
  }

  //* Const Modifier on Type Parameters

  // From version 5.0 of TypeScript, it is possible to specify the const attribute on a generic type parameter. This allows for inferring the most precise type possible. Let’s see an example WITHOUT using `const`:
  {
    function identity<T>(value: T) {
      // No `const` here
      return value;
    }

    const values = identity({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }); // Type inferred is: { a: string; b: string; }

    // As you can see, the properties `a` and `b` are inferred with a type of `string` .
  }

  // Now, let’s see the difference with the `const` version:
  {
    function identity<const T>(value: T) {
      // Using `const` modifier on type parameters
      return value;
    }

    const values = identity({ a: 'a', b: 'b' }); // Type inferred is: { a: "a"; b: "b"; }

    // Now we can see that the properties `a` and `b` are inferred as `const`, so `a` and `b` are treated as string literals (fixed string value) rather than just `string` types.
  }

  //* Const assertion

  // This feature allows you to declare a variable with a more precise literal type based on its initialization value, signifying to the compiler that the value should be treated as an immutable literal. Here are a few examples:

  // On a single property:
  {
    const v = {
      x: 3 as const,
    };
    v.x = 3;
  }

  // On an entire object:
  {
    const v = {
      x: 1,
      y: 2,
    } as const;
  }

  // This can be particularly useful when defining the type for a `tuple`:
  {
    const x = [1, 2, 3]; // number[]
    const y = [1, 2, 3] as const; // Tuple of readonly [1, 2, 3]
  }

  //* Explicit Type Annotation

  // We can be specific and pass a type, in the following example property `x` is of type `number`:
  {
    const v = {
      x: 1, // Inferred type: number (widening)
    };
    v.x = 3; // Valid
  }

  // We can make the type annotation more specific by using a union of literal types:
  {
    const v: { x: 1 | 2 | 3 } = {
      x: 1, // `x` is now a union of literal types: 1 | 2 | 3
    };
    v.x = 1; // Valid
    v.x = 2; // Valid
    v.x = 3; // Valid
    // v.x = 100; // Invalid
  }

  //* Type Narrowing

  // Type Narrowing is the process in TypeScript where a general type is narrowed down to a more specific type. This occurs when TypeScript analyzes the code and determines that certain conditions or operations can refine the type information.

  // Narrowing types can occur in different ways, including:

  // TODO: Conditions

  // By using conditional statements, such as `if` or `switch`, TypeScript can narrow down the type based on the outcome of the condition. For example:
  {
    let x: number | undefined = 10;

    if (x != undefined) {
      x += 10; // The type is number, which had been narrowed by the condition
    }
  }

  // TODO: Throwing or returning

  // Throwing an error or returning early from a branch can be used to help TypeScript narrow down a type. For example:
  {
    let x: number | undefined = 10;

    if (x === undefined) throw new Error('Error');

    x += 10;
  }

  //* IMPORTANT: Other ways to narrow down types in TypeScript include:
  /*
  1. `instanceof` operator: Used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class.

  2. `in` operator: Used to check if a property exists in an object.

  3. `typeof` operator: Used to check the type of a value at runtime.

  4. Built-in functions like `Array.isArray()`: Used to check if a value is an array.
  */

  //* Discriminated Union

  // Using a “Discriminated Union” is a pattern in TypeScript where an explicit “tag” is added to objects to distinguish between different types within a union. This pattern is also referred to as a “tagged union.” In the following example, the “tag” is represented by the property “type”:

  {
    type A = { type: 'type_a'; value: number };
    type B = { type: 'type_b'; value: string };

    const x = (input: A | B): string | number => {
      if (input.type === 'type_a') return input.value + 100;
      else return input.value + 'extra';
    };
  }
}
