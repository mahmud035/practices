  // Fixed Length Tuple

  // A Fixed Length Tuple is a specific type of tuple that enforces a fixed number of elements of specific types, and disallows any modifications to the length of the tuple once it is defined.

  // Fixed Length Tuples are useful when you need to represent a collection of values with a specific number of elements and specific types, and you want to ensure that the length and types of the tuple cannot be changed inadvertently.

  const Tuple = [10, 'hello'] as const;

  // Tuple.push(2); // ðŸ”´ Error
