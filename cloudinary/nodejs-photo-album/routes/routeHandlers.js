This function is designed to handle the uploading of large video files to Cloudinary in manageable chunks. It uses the cloudinary.uploader.upload_large method, which is specifically designed for uploading large files, like videos, in smaller chunks to avoid common issues that arise with large uploads, such as timeouts or memory overload.

The video file being uploaded (singapore.mp4) is located in a folder called `video` within the local project directory. Note how the upload function specifies the resource_type as 'video', ensuring Cloudinary processes the file as a video. It also sets a chunk_size, defining the size of each piece into which the video will be divided during the upload process.

The function then responds with the secure URL of the uploaded video, allowing it to be accessed. This structure makes the function both reliable for large file uploads and capable of handling errors effectively.

/*
The `uploadLocalFromBrowserChunked` function is designed to handle file uploads from the browser in chunks, allowing large files to be uploaded piece by piece rather than all at once. This is useful for managing large file uploads efficiently, especially in cases where the client may be constrained by bandwidth or where interruptions could occur during the upload. 

The function starts by extracting the file data from the request. If no file is provided, it immediately sends a 400 error response. Next, it checks for two required headers: `x-unique-upload-id`, which uniquely identifies the upload, and `content-range`, which specifies the byte range of the chunk being uploaded. If either of these headers is missing, the function returns a 400 error indicating the problem.

Once the headers are validated, the function parses the `Content-Range` header to extract the start, end, and total size of the file. These values allow the function to determine where the current chunk fits in the larger file. The function then ensures that a local directory exists to store the uploaded chunks, creating it if necessary, and opens a write stream to append the current chunk to the correct file.

After writing the chunk to disk, the function checks whether the total file size has been reached. If the file is complete, it proceeds to upload the entire file to Cloudinary using the `upload_large` method, which handles large files in chunks. Once the upload to Cloudinary is complete, the temporary file is deleted, and the function responds with the URL of the uploaded file. If only part of the file has been received, the function responds with a message indicating the size of the data received so far.
