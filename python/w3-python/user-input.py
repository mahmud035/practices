# Python User Input:

# User Input:
# Python allows for user input.
# That means we are able to ask the user for input.
# Python 3.6 uses the `input()` method.

# The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:

# Ex:
user_name = input("Enter username: ")
print(f"Username is: {user_name}")

# WARNING: Python stops executing when it comes to the `input()` function, and continues when the user has given some input.
